# python_design
This is my scaffolding python with :
- flask 
- SQLalchemy (orm)
- DB (postgres/mariadb ? not sure )
- celery (redis)
- cloudrun: Currently push to master will trigger deployment

TODO:
[ ] finalize CI/CD
[ ] Add some basic functionality 
[ ] split pytest (it should not included) to reduce image size ?
